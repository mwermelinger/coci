# COCI 2006/07 contest \#1

On the COCI website you can find:

- The descriptions of the 5 problems:
  a [PDF file](https://hsin.hr/coci/archive/2006_2007/contest1_tasks.pdf).
  You need to read this first.
- The test data:
  a [zip archive](https://hsin.hr/coci/archive/2006_2007/contest1_testdata.zip)
  with one folder per problem.
  Each folder has several input files and the corresponding output files.
  You need this if you want to modify and run my programs on the test data.
- The solutions:
  a [zip archive](https://hsin.hr/coci/archive/2006_2007/contest1_solutions.zip)
  with a solution outline and two programs (Pascal and C++) for each problem.

My Python implementations are:

- [Modulo](modulo.ipynb)
