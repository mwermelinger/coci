The Croatian Open Contest in Informatics (COCI) is a series of 6 online
contests per year, each consisting of 5 problems to be solved in 3 hours,
like in the International Olympiads in Informatics (IOI).

The [COCI website](https://hsin.hr/coci/) has past problems
and their test data and solutions. For each problem,
there's an outline of how to approach it and a C++, C or Pascal program.
Unfortunately, identifiers and comments are in Croatian.
I've thus started re-implementing the official solutions in Python
to make them more widely accessible.
